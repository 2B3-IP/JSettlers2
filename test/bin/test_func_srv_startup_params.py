# JSettlers functional testing: Server startup params
# Covers command-line params and jsserver.properties files
# See bottom of file for copyright and license information (GPLv3+).

# File/directory assumptions at runtime:
# - This script lives in test/bin/
# - Properties files can be created and deleted in test/tmp/
# - Server JAR has been built already, to ../../target/JSettlersServer.jar
